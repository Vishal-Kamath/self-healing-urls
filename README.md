# Self Healing URLs

Self-healing URLs refer to an approach where URLs are designed to adapt or correct themselves when broken or when the linked content changes. These URLs are created dynamically to redirect users to the correct content even if the initial link is outdated or invalid.

For instance, a self-healing URL might include a unique identifier or metadata that allows it to recognize when the content it points to has changed or moved. When someone accesses this URL, the system behind it checks the identifier or metadata to determine the current location or version of the content and redirects the user accordingly.

This approach is especially useful for maintaining links in dynamic environments like content management systems, where content is frequently updated, moved, or deleted. Self-healing URLs help ensure a smoother user experience by minimizing the impact of broken links and providing users with access to the intended content even when URLs change over time.
